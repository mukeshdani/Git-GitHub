<h1 align="center"> Introduction 💥</h1>

In this Repo we are learning the basics of Git & GitHub, how it works, etc.

# What is Git?
Git is a free, open-source version control software. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. This tool is a version control system that was initially developed to work with several developers on the Linux kernel.

## **Git Repositories**
If we want to start using Git, we need to know where to host our repositories.

A repository (or “Repo” for short) is a project that contains multiple files. In our case a repository will contain code-based files.

There are two ways you can host your repositories. One is online (on the cloud) and the second is offline (self-installed on your server).

There are three popular Git hosting services: **GitHub** (owned by **Microsoft**), **GitLab** (owned by **GitLab**) and **BitBucket**.

## **why we need it**
  * Git makes it easy to contribute to open source projects ☺️

  * Documentation 😍

  * Integration options

 * Track changes in your code across versions 🖥️

 * Showcase your work 😄


## **Git installation**

 * install Git and GitHub with apt-get

     sudo apt-get install git

* verify that Git is installed correctly

    git --version

* set a default username and email when you’re going to save your work.

    git config --global user.name "MUKESH DANI"
    git config --global user.email "mukeshdani00@gmail.com"



## **Working with GitHub projects**
We’ll work with GitHub projects in two ways.   

**1 👉** : *Work on your project locally then create the repository on GitHub and push it to remote.*

**Initialize directory :**

### git init 
initializes your directory to work with git and
makes a local repository. .git folder is made

*OR*

### git clone http_url 
This is done if we have an existing git repository.
